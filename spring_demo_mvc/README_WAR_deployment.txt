1. In Eclipse, stop Tomcat

2. Right-click your project and select Export > WAR File

3. In the Destination field, enter: <any-directory>/mycoolapp.war

4. Outside of Eclipse, start Tomcat
- If you are using MS Windows, then you should find it on the Start menu

5. Make sure Tomcat is up and running by visiting: http://localhost:8080

6. Deploy your new WAR file by copying it to <tomcat-install-directory>\webapps

Give it about 10-15 seconds to make the deployment. You'll know the deployment is over because you'll see a new folder created in webapps ... with your WAR file name.

7. Visit your new app. If your war file was: mycoolapp.war then you can access it with:  http://localhost:8080/mycoolapp/

(Make sure war is present in correct tomcat installation directory and correct port are used for HTTP)
